In this notebook i have covered all important topics about `Logistic Regression`. It is a classifiaction problem solving algorithm. 
It is mainly used for the of binary classification problem.  
I also explain how sigmoid function works. 
What is the difference between `Logistic Regression` and `Linear Regression` model ?
Why do we call this algorithm `Logistic Regression`, not Logistic Classification ?
