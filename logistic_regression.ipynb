    "\n",
    "1. What is Logistic Regression? \n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm that predicts Yes/No, 0/1, Spam/Not Spam, Disease/No Disease, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses a linear equation + sigmoid function to predict probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why do we need Logistic Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because linear regression gives output like:\n",
    "\n",
    "-5, 2, 100, 0.34, 999 …\n",
    "\n",
    "But classification needs:\n",
    "\n",
    "0 or 1 \n",
    "Yes or No\n",
    "\n",
    "So we use sigmoid to convert any number into probability between 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How Logistic Regression Works : \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1️⃣ — Create a linear equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like linear regression: \n",
    "\n",
    "z = w1*x1 + w2*x2 + b\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2️⃣ — Pass z through Sigmoid\n",
    "\n",
    "Sigmoid formula: \n",
    "\n",
    "p = 1 / (1 + e^-z)\n",
    "\n",
    "This converts z into probability between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3️⃣ — Use probability to classify\n",
    "\n",
    "if p > 0.5 → Class 1  \n",
    "if p ≤ 0.5 → Class 0\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Easy Real-Life Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we predict whether a student will pass an exam based on study hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Hours studied | Pass (1=yes, 0=no) |\n",
    "| ------------- | ------------------ |\n",
    "| 1             | 0                  |\n",
    "| 2             | 0                  |\n",
    "| 3             | 0                  |\n",
    "| 4             | 1                  |\n",
    "| 5             | 1                  |\n",
    "| 7             | 1                  |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Model learns:\n",
    "\n",
    "➡ More hours → higher chance of passing\n",
    "\n",
    "➡ But it should NOT output marks like linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "➡ It should output probability of passing\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If student studies 3.5 hours, model may output: \n",
    "\n",
    "p = 0.42  →  class 0\n",
    "\n",
    "If studies 6 hours: \n",
    "\n",
    "p = 0.87 → class 1\n",
    "\n",
    "So logistic regression = probability + threshold.\n",

    "##### 5. **Why is it called “Logistic Regression” and not Logistic Classification?** \n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Because it uses regression on probabilities (predicts continuous values 0–1, -5, 2, 100, 0.34, 999 …).\n",
    "\n",
    "✔ Only after regression, we convert probability → class (0 or 1, Yes or No, Spam or Not Spam, ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "So name = “regression on probability” → Logistic Regression\n",
